This is my attempt of the first "The odin project" project. 

In this project, I will be creating a recipe website, using HTML. This project will consist of :

1. Writing the HTML Boilerplate 
2. Working with text
3. Add lists of recipes 
4. Link recipe to recipe's page
5. Add images 

Finally, the project will also allows me to put my git knowlodges in practice.

I hope you will enjoy the available recipes :D
